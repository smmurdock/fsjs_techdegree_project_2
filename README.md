Unit 2 Project - List Pagination and Filtering 

In this project, you'll enhance the usability of a web page that is displaying way too much information all at once. Long lists don't make for a good user experience on a web page. To make it easier for the user to find information and read the page, you'll add to this project a popular web development technique known as "pagination".

While making these improvements, you'll adhere to an important development principle known as "progressive enhancement". Which in this case basically just means that you'll add JavaScript to enhance the web page, without making the web page dependent upon the JavaScript that you are adding.

In other words, you'll add JavaScript to paginate and improve the project, without altering the project in such a way that JavaScript becomes required to use or view the web page.

With "progressive enhancement" in mind, you'll write the code to take this default list of 54 students and break it up into separate pages that display only 10 students at a time. Additionally, you'll programmitcally add buttons to the bottom of the page that allow users to navigate through the list, 10 students at a time.

Your pagination solution should be dynamic, meaning it will work for any list containing any number of items.

An optional search feature task will give you the opportunity to earn an Exceeds Expectation grade on this project while learning about filtering in a web page. It is highly recommended that you aim for exceeds as doing so will strengthen your skills, add to your experience, and give you cooler projects to show off to potential employers.

Avoid using plugins to achieve the pagination and/or search functionality. While there are a number of tools out there to help with this sort of feature, for your education and career it is important for you to gain experience and understanding of these techniques and how they work, "under the hood".
